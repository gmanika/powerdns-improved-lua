Prerequisites
-------------

To compile this Oracle backend for PowerDNS, the following is needed:

	PowerDNS Dynamic RPM/DEB Version 2.1 or higher
		http://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/rpm-dynamic
		http://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/deb/unstable
	PowerDNS Backend Development Kit Version 2.1 or higher
		http://downloads.powerdns.com/releases/dev
	gcc 3.0 and gcc 3.0 libraries

It may be necessary to install gcc 3.0 before installing PowerDNS to prevent
unresolved dependencies. Also, make sure that you are using gcc 3.0 as a
compiler.  You may need to edit the Makefile to make sure.

RedHat
------

For RedHat 7.2, gcc 3.0 is available by default. For RedHat 7.3, please
install the gcc 3.0 packages from RedHat 7.2 updates, they work just fine.
For RedHat Advanced Server 2.1, gcc 3.0 packages are available by default.

Debian
------

For Debian 'Woody', install gcc-3.0 and g++-3.0.

Compiling
---------

It is best to place the Oracle backend and the PDNS Backend Development kit
side by side in the same directory. The Oracle backend searches for the
development kit in the parent directory by default.

If all the requirements are met, run 'make' followed by 'make install', run
as root. Edit the Makefile if your Oracle client installation does not
reside in /opt/oracle or the development kit is not in ../

If all proceeds as it should, PowerDNS should now have access to the
'oracle' backend. Enable it by specifying 'launch=oracle' in the
documentation.
