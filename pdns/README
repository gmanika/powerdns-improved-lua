To compile a very basic version, use:

$ ./configure --with-modules=""
$ make
# make install

This generates a PowerDNS binary with no modules, except the bind backend,
built in. When ./configure is run without --with-modules, the mysql module
is built by default.

To add multiple modules, try:

$ ./configure --with-modules="mysql mypgsql"

For postgresql, you will probably have to edit modules/mypgsql/Makefile.in -
see the TODO file

After compiling, you may find the file 'pdns/pdns' helpful, we suggest you
place it in /etc/init.d/ or your operating system's equivalent.
