Mostly polish on the build process:

	- make sure only Linux gets -D_GNU_SOURCE
	- make PostgreSQL and MySQL include and library paths configurable
	- compilation on FreeBSD is probably broken right now
	- add support for building dynamic modules again
		.so files that can be loaded at runtime and distributed
		separately

	- in the CVS repository live far more backends:
	- rebuild 'rpm' target, 'deb' target, FreeBSD 'port'

$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anon@outpost.ds9a.nl:/var/cvsroot
$ cvs login
CVS password: [enter 'cvs' (without 's)]
$ cvs co pdns
cvs server: Updating pdns
...

	- In ./modules you will find a number of exciting modules that need to
	  be tought to add themselves to the 'distdir', so they appear in
	  'make dist', the PowerDNS distribution.

	
Real work:
	- Solaris version
	- Mac OS X version (has been done, partly)
	- resurrect W2K version
