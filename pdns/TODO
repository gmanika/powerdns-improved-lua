immediate issues:
	make install does not strip

	make install installs libraries with a static build which it should
		not

	pdns_server should be in sbin

Things we will not do but hope other people will:
	- Ports to NetBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX
	- Michel Stol is already working on reviving his win32 port

Projects we will be working on, but would like help for:

Big things:
	- Add recursion
		bert hubert is working on this based on MTasker
		http://ds9a.nl/mtasker
	- Add support for TSIG

Medium size things:
	- Improve bind 'workalike' mode so we are a drop-in replacement for
	  non-resolving bind. We're 90% there.
		Add support for being master/slave in bind mode
			this basically is filling in the blanks
	- get PDNS into Red Hat 8.x 
		needs very good RPMS 	
		need to get Red Hat interested
	- get PDNS into Debian Sid
		Wichert Akkerman is working on this
	- get PDNS into FreeBSD ports
	- and other architectures	


Small things, great for coders new to PowerDNS:
	- add LOC record
	- add KEY record
	- add SIG record
	- get the xdb backend building again
	- make sure only Linux gets -D_GNU_SOURCE
		doesn't hurt other architectures, but its ugly
	- investigate if the following is better for the spgsql driver:
int SPgSQL::doQuery(const string &query)
{
  ExecStatusType stat;
  stat=d_db->Exec(query.c_str());
  if(stat!=PGRES_COMMAND_OK && stat!=PGRES_TUPLES_OK)
    throw sPerrorException("PostgreSQL failed to execute command");

  d_count=0;
  return 0;
}



Mostly polish on the build process:
	- add support for building dynamic modules again
		.so files that can be loaded at runtime and distributed
		separately


$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anon@outpost.ds9a.nl:/var/cvsroot
$ cvs login
CVS password: [enter 'cvs' (without 's)]
$ cvs co pdns
cvs server: Updating pdns
...

	- In ./modules you will find a number of exciting modules that need to
	  be tought to add themselves to the 'distdir', so they appear in
	  'make dist', the PowerDNS distribution.

	
Real work:
	- Solaris version
	- Mac OS X version (has been done, partly)
	- resurrect W2K version
