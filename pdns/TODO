don't read 'hint' and 'forward' sections

bugs:
	pdns.conf-dist contains old descriptions

Things we will not do but hope other people will:
	- Ports to NetBSD, OpenBSD, AIX

Projects we will be working on, but would like help for:

Big things:
	- Add recursion
		bert hubert is working on this based on MTasker
		http://ds9a.nl/mtasker
	- Add support for TSIG

Medium size things:
	- 64 bit cleanliness
		compiles on 64 bit, but does it work?
	- Improve bind 'workalike' mode so we are a drop-in replacement for
	  non-resolving bind. We're 90% there.
		Add support for being master/slave in bind mode
			this basically is filling in the blanks
	- get PDNS into Red Hat 8.x 
		needs very good RPMS 	
		need to get Red Hat interested
	- get PDNS into FreeBSD ports
	- and other architectures	
	- test powerdns in a windows environment!


Small things, great for coders new to PowerDNS:
	- add LOC record
	- add KEY record
	- add SIG record
	- get the xdb backend building again
	- 'make distclean' tries to calculate dependencies in
		modules/pgmysqlbackend, which is not needed

	- investigate if the following is better for the spgsql driver:
int SPgSQL::doQuery(const string &query)
{
  ExecStatusType stat;
  stat=d_db->Exec(query.c_str());
  if(stat!=PGRES_COMMAND_OK && stat!=PGRES_TUPLES_OK)
    throw sPerrorException("PostgreSQL failed to execute command");

  d_count=0;
  return 0;
}
