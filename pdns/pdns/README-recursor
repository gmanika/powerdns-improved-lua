The only dependency is Boost, http://boost.org/
You only need to download it, there is no need to compile.

On most Linux distributions, you can simply install 'boost' or 'boost-dev'
or 'boost-devel'. If you don't have that option, or don't want to use it,
try:

1) head to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586 and
download the latest boost tar.bz2 or tar.gz, perhaps from:
http://surfnet.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/boost/boost_1_33_1.tar.bz2
(use the first link if this one doesn't work)

2) untar it:

$ tar xjf boost_1_33_1.tar.bz2

3) Compile the PowerDNS recursor using:

$ CXXFLAGS=-I./boost-1.33.1/ make

4) Run ./pdns_recursor and you should be set!


PERFORMANCE
-----------

For the utmost in performance, compile like this:

   $ PROFILEFLAGS=-fprofile-generate make

Then run the program for a bit, in as much of a real-life setting as you
have available. Then run:

   $ rec_control quit
   bye 

Then do:

   $ PROFILEFLAGS=-fprofile-use make clean all

The resulting binary is up to 20% faster in our tests.

PROBLEMS
--------
If you have problems linking, try removing the GCC_SKIP_LOCKING line from
config.h
