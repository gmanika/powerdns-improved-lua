The only dependency is Boost, http://boost.org/
You only need to download it, there is no need to compile.

On most Linux distributions, you can simply install 'boost' or 'boost-dev'
or 'boost-devel'. If you don't have that option, or don't want to use it,
try:

1) head to http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586 and
download the latest boost tar.bz2 or tar.gz, perhaps from:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/boost/boost_1_33_1.tar.bz2?download

2) untar it:

$ tar xjf boost_1_33_1.tar.bz2

3) Compile the PowerDNS recursor using:

$ CXXFLAGS=-I./boost-1.33.1/ make
