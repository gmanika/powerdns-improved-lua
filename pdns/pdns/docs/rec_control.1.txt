NAME
----
rec_control - control pdns_recursor

SYNOPSIS
--------
'rec_control' [--help] [--socket-dir] [--socket-pid] command ..

DESCRIPTION
-----------
rec_control(1) allows the operator to control a running instance
of the pdns_recursor.

The commands that can be passed to the recursor are described on
http://doc.powerdns.com/rec-control.html

EXAMPLES
--------

To stop the recursor by hand, run:

	# rec_control quit

To dump the cache to disk, execute:

	# rec_control dump-cache /tmp/the-cache

OPTIONS
-------

--help::
	provide this helpful message

--socket-dir::
	Where the controlsocket will live

--socket-pid::
	When running in SMP mode, pid of pdns_recursor to control

COMMANDS
--------
dump-cache filename::
	Dumps the entire cache to the filename mentioned. This file should
	not exist already, PowerDNS will refuse to overwrite it. While
	dumping, the recursor will not answer questions.

get statistic::
	Retrieve a statistic. For items that can be queried, see
	http://doc.powerdns.com/recursor-stats.html

ping::
	Check if server is alive.

quit::
	Request shutdown of the recursor

top-remotes::
	Shows the top-20 most active remote hosts. Statistics are over the
	last 'remotes-ringbuffer-entries' queries, which defaults to 0.

wipe-cache domain0 [domain1]::
	Wipe entries from the cache. This is useful if, for example, an
	important server has a new IP address, but the TTL has not yet
	expired. Multiple domain names can be passed. Note that you must
	terminate a domain with a .!  So to wipe powerdns.org, issue
	'rec_control wipe-cache powerdns.org.'.
	Versions beyond 3.1 don't need the trailing dot. Consider not only
	wiping 'www.domain.com.' but also 'domain.com.', as the cached nameservers
	or target of CNAME may continue to be undesired.
