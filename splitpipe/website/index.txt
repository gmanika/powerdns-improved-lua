****************************************************

Splitpipe is a program that allows the output of a program to span multiple
volumes. Volumes might be DVD's, CD's, files, entire hard disks or floppies.

A command line says more than a thousand words:

--------------------------------------------------
# tar czf - /home | splitpipe -s dvd -o 'growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/dev/stdin'
To restore:
# joinpipe /dev/dvd | tar xzf -
--------------------------------------------------

The two lines above backup */home* to one, or more DVDs, prompting the
operator to change media once a volume is full. For more, see
link:examples.html[Examples].

Features
--------
 * Running MD5 checksum
 * Detects truncated volumes
 * Impervious to trailing garbage (which you get when piping raw data
   to cdrecord or growisofs)
 * Detects improper order of volumes on restore
 * Each session has a UUID, so volumes from other backups are rejected
 * Large and efficient ringbuffer
 * Works with cdrecord, growisofs, bare files and floppies
