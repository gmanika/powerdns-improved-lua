Roadmap
=======

While splitpipe is a useful program already, much more is in the works!

The data format (link:splitpipe-0.2/doc/splitpipe.5.html[splitpipe(5)])
and buffer of splitpipe have been built such that it is possible to restart
failed volumes, provided they fail early enough.

This would allow the operated to continue a backup after, for example,
inserting a used DVD instead of an empty one.

Much the same goes for restoring, splitpipe can already detect if a wrong
volume was inserted. It should then of course offer the operator the chance
of entering the right volume.

User interface
--------------
Instead of only listening to the user when changing volumes, it might be a
good idea to offer single-key commands while burning. Pressing *i* might
give information on the current state of the ring buffer, pressing *q* might
send a kill signal to the burn program etc.
