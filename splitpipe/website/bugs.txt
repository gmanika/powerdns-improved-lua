Reporting bugs
==============

To report bugs, please describe clearly:

 * The version of splitpipe you are using
 * Which operating system splitpipe is installed on
 * If you compiled the program yourself, or used a package (if so, specify
   which one)
 * If burning media, which program and which version you use (cdrecord,
   growisofs etc)
 * The exact command line you entered

More complicated:

 * Explain what you *expected* splitpipe to do
 * What it did instead
 * Which, if any, errors it reported
 * Be honest about odd things you may be doing. If you own the world's only
   Firewire DVD burner, I need to know!

Please supply the data above 'even' if you think it can't possibly be
relevant to your problem.

If you have compiled the above, please email bert hubert <ahu@ds9a.nl>. In
the future there will be a bug tracker, probably 'trac'.
