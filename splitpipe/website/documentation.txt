Documentation
=============

Currently you'll have to do with these three manpages, which describe
version 0.2 (and *not* 0.1!).

 * link:splitpipe-0.2/doc/splitpipe.1.html[splitpipe(1)]
 * link:splitpipe-0.2/doc/joinpipe.1.html[joinpipe(1)]
 * link:splitpipe-0.2/doc/splitpipe.5.html[splitpipe(5)]

You may also want to read the link:splitpipe-0.2/README[README].
