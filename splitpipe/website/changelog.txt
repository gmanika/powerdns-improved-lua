Changes in the current repository, which will become 0.3
--------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: 'splitpipe' is a young project, and the snapshots are even younger.
Be very careful! 

The big change this time is the move to a split-screen layout, allowing the
operator to simultaneously see the what the output script is up to, as well
as information on the operation of splitpipe itself.

A snapshot is available link:splitpipe-0.3.tar.gz[here].

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
 - Accidentally allocated twice as much memory as was specified by *-b*. 

Changes
~~~~~~~
 - Volumes are now counted starting from '1', at least visibly. Internally 
   the first volume is still '0' of course!

Features
~~~~~~~~
 - Split screen mode. This has added ncurses to our dependencies
 - The buffer is now being filled even while waiting for user input
 - Pressing ^L now redraws the screen, as expected (BROKEN)
 - Each volume now contains the date the backup was started
 - Added --label, -L to give the session a name
 - On encountering an out of order volume, or an volume from another
   session, joinpipe now offers the user the chance to retry

Changes in version 0.2, released 19th of April 2005
---------------------------------------------------

The big change is maturity, the program has now actually seen use in various
places. Regarding terminology, the word 'Chunk' has been replaced by
'Volume', as it is more intuitive.

Portability
~~~~~~~~~~~
 * FreeBSD deals differently with setting a file to non-blocking (reported
   Niels Bakker)
 * Verified compilation and regression checks on Solaris (Koos van den Hout)

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
 * There was a theoretical possibility that the program would block during a write
   because of changes from blocking to non-blocking.
 * No --help was output when -o was missing (noted by Pedro Larroy)

Features
~~~~~~~~
 * *--no-prompt* was added to instruct the programs not to prompt the 
   user to change volumes.
 * Regression tests were expanded to monitor quality
 * *splitpipe* and *joinpipe* are now one binary, to save disk space, and
   help make sure they are always in sync (suggested by Kei and Mel Roman)

Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * *--verify* was dropped from the *joinpipe* *--help* output, as it is not
   implemented
 * Manpages were added, as well as an informative website
