NAME
----
splitpipe - spread piped input over a number of volumes (DVD's, CD's etc)

SYNOPSIS
--------
'splitpipe' -o command [--buffer-size, -b] [--volume-size, -s] [--help, -h]
		       [--no-prompt, -n] [--verbose, -v]
		       [--debug, -d] [--version]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
splitpipe(1) accepts input, either from files, pipes or sockets and, using a
large buffer for performance reasons, outputs it over one or more volumes.
Volumes can be DVD's, CD's, floppies, hard disks or files.

This allows the operator to make, for example, tar(1) archives larger than a
single DVD.

Volumes contain markers to signify which backup session they belong to, and
their order in the set. Furthermore, a running checksum is kept to guarantee
data integrity.

Volumes created by splitpipe(1) can be read by joinpipe(1)

EXAMPLES
--------

To backup /home to one or more DVDs:

 # tar czf - /home | splitpipe -s dvd  -o 'growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/dev/stdin'

To restore:

 # joinpipe /dev/dvd | tar xzf -

OPTIONS
-------
--help, -h::
	Print a helpful message

--version::
	Print version information

--ouput program, -o::
	This specifies a script, either shell, or a program that is called
	for each volume. Mandatory.

--buffer-size, -b::
	Configures the size of the buffer between input and output. In
	megabytes. Defaults to 10.

--volume-size, -s::
	Sets the maximum size of volume output to this number of kilobytes.
	Alternatively, a preset size may be specified. Currently defined
	volume sizes are: 'floppy', 'cd', 'cd-80', 'cdr-80', 'dvd' and 
	'dvd-5'. Run 'splitpipe --help' for the most up to date list.

--no-prompt, -n::
	Do not prompt the user to change volumes. Mostly useful when writing
	to files, but might also come in handy with automated disk changers.

--verbose, -v::
	Be verbose, but not overly so. 

--debug, -d::
	Give large amounts of debugging output, possibly damaging
	performance

BUGS
----
Does not yet allow retrying failed output, even when the failed data is 
still available in the ringbuffer.
