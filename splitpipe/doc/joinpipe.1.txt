NAME
----
joinpipe - joins volumes generated by splitpipe(1) to standard output

SYNOPSIS
--------
'joinpipe' 		[--help, -h] [--no-prompt, -n] [--verbose, -v]
		      	[--debug, -d] [--version] device1 file2 ...


DESCRIPTION
-----------
joinpipe(1) joins volumes generated by splitpipe(1) to standard output.
In doing so, it checks the proper order of inserted volumes, if these
volumes all belong to the same backup session. Integrity of data
is verified using a running checksum, currently MD5.

Volumes are read from the devices or filenames specified on the command
line. When passing multiple names, the first volume is read from the first
name, the second volume from the second name etc. When there are more
volumes than names, remaining volumes are read in from the last name
specified.

EXAMPLES
--------

To backup /home to one or more DVDs:

 # tar czf - /home | splitpipe -c dvd  -o 'growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/dev/stdin'

To restore:

 # joinpipe /dev/dvd | tar xzf -


OPTIONS
-------
--help, -h::
	Print a helpful message

--version::
	Print version information

--no-prompt, -n::
	Do not prompt the user to change volumes. Mostly useful when writing
	to files, but might also come in handy with automated disk changers.

--verbose, -v::
	Be verbose, but not overly so. 

--debug, -d::
	Give large amounts of debugging output, possibly damaging
	performance

BUGS
----
Does not yet allow retrying failed input, for example, after inserting the
wrong volume.
