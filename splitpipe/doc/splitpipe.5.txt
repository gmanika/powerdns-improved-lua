NAME
----
splitpipe - data format used by splitpipe(1) and joinpipe(1)

SYNOPSIS
--------
The splitpipe data format is used by splitpipe(1) and joinpipe(1)
to allow piped data to span volumes.

DEFINITIONS
-----------
session::
	All data sent to splitpipe. In other words, the full pipe.

volume::
	Sessions are split into volumes, each volume might be a CD, DVD,
	disk or file.

stretch::
	Each volume consists of stretches. Each stretch includes its own
	length, excluding its own three byte header. A stretch also has a
	type, each of which has its own meaning. One of these types is
	'data'.

STRETCHES
---------
Currently, the following stretch types have been allocated, followed by
their assigned type number:

Session Name (0)::
	Optional name given to this session. Intended for human consumption.

Session UUID (1)::
	Used to verify that a volume belongs to a session

Volume Number (2)::
	Incremented by 1 for each volume, starting at zero, to verify
	the proper order of volumes within a session.

Volume EOF (3)::
	Designates the end of a volume. Not to be used on the last volume!

Data (4)::
	Actual content of the pipe

MD5 Checksum (5)::
	Running MD5 checksum of all Data stretch contents up to this
	stretch. 

SHA1 Checksum (6)::
	Running SHA1 checksum of all Data stretch contents up to this
	stretch. 

Session EOF (7)::
	Designates end of a session. Implies a Volume EOF.

FORMAT
------
Each stretch starts with 16 bits in which its size is stored, in network
byte order. This is followed by 8 bits which describe the type.

SEMANTICS
---------
The reader of a splitpipe stream is free to ignore optional stretch types,
but the following behaviour is mandatory.

Each volume has, before the first Data stretch, at least a UUID and Volume
stretch. A volume shall end with a Volume EOF stretch, except when it is the
last volume in a session, in which case it shall end on a Session EOF.

MD5 or SHA1 checksum stretches may be interleaved at any point during the
stream, but shall at least be included at the end of each volume.
