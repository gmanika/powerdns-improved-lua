splitpipe allows streaming piped output to span multiple volumes, which
might be floppies, cd-recordables, dvd's or whatnot.

joinpipe performs the reverse process.

No temporary files are used.

WARNING
-------

This is the very first release, so it will eat data and in fact destroy your
orginal files. Count on it.

BUGS
----

Report to ahu@ds9a.nl - be verbose, ie, tell me what you expect the program
to do, what it did instead, and what is said during the process.

MODE OF OPERATION
-----------------

Splitpipe accepts the output of, say, tar on standard input and distributes
it over multiple volumes. These volumes contain labels that guarantee
integrity, verify that the entire volume is read, and that they are read in
the proper order.

This allows for the backup of full filesystems, at high speed.

FEATURES
--------

 * Running MD5 checksum
 * Detects truncated volumes
 * Impervious to trailing garbage (which you get when piping raw data
   to cdrecord or growisofs)
 * Detects improper order of volumes on restore
 * Each session has a UUID, so volumes from other backups are rejected
 * Large and efficient ringbuffer
 * Works with cdrecord, growisofs, bare files and floppies

COMPILING
---------

Needs g++, there are no other dependencies. On Solaris you will need GNU
Make.

$ make
# make install

CDRECORD SAMPLES
----------------

# tar czf - /home | splitpipe -c cdr-80 -o ./cdrecord-script

This makes 700mbyte cd-recordables of your /home, using the default 10
megabyte buffer. Once a disk is full, you'll be prompted to insert a
new volume, and press enter.

In our experience, the following works better:

# tar cf - /home | gzip --fast | splitpipe -b 100000 -c cdr-80 -v \ 
  -o ./cdrecord-script

This loses some compression but saves heaps of cpu time. 

To restore, insert the first cd and run:

# joinpipe /dev/cdrom | tar xzf -

When prompted, insert a new disk and press enter.

GROWISOFS SAMPLES
-----------------

Very similar:

# tar cf - /home | gzip --fast | splitpipe -c dvd \
  -o 'growisofs -Z /dev/dvd=/dev/stdin'

To restore:

# joinpipe /dev/dvd | tar xzf -

TESTING WITH REGULAR FILES
--------------------------

To test to regular files, try:

# tar czf - /home | splitpipe -b 100000 -c cdr-80 -v -o 'cat > output.$$'

To test, ise:

# joinpipe -v output.* /dev/null
