splitpipe allows piped output to span multiple volumes, which might be
floppies, cd-recordables, dvd's or whatnot.

This is the very first release, so it will eat data and in fact destroy your
orginal files. Count on it.

Sample:

# tar czf - /home | splitpipe -b 100000 -c cdr-80 -v ./cdrecord-script

This makes 700mbyte cd-recordables of your /home, using a 100 megabyte
buffer. In our experience, the following works better:

# tar cf - /home | gzip --fast | splitpipe -b 100000 -c cdr-80 -v ./cdrecord-script

This loses some compression but saves heaps of cpu time.
