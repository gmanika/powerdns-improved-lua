EASY:
	- figure out exact byte sizes of CDR, CDR-80, DVD

MEDIUM:
	- add date/time session stretch

	- add "name" chunk stretch

	- i18n

	- figure out how to prevent ncurses from clearing the screen on exit

	- write a minimal shell script that can function like joinpipe
		might give people a secure feeling
		something along the lines of:

		( 
		while true; 
		do dd if=/dev/stdin bs=1 count=2 ; hexdump | 
		..
		) < file

HARD:
	- output of cdrecord is fugly, perhaps add --cdrecord for prettifying

	- implement retreat
		so we can recover from broken disks etc

	- implement retry in joinpipe

	- define environment variables
	
	- take out getopt_long stuff, it is somewhat ugly

	- open /dev/tty and poll it in the loop
		this means we can continue reading when waiting for a key
		press!

	- allow single key commands during the process

Done:

DONE!	- make buildStretch, which appends stretches to a string

DONE!	- teach writen about EAGAIN

DONE!	- manpages

DONE!	- perhaps merge split and joinpipe (suggestion of "Kei" and Mel Roman)

hmm	- write dvdrecord-script
