- implement chunking
	first restore from cd failed because cd's have atomic sector sizes,
	so concat of second cd fails

- related, implement md5sum - perhaps before next chunk?

- specification of program to run is weak, ideal is what "strace" does
	simple alternative is --command "blah blah blah", and then feed all
	that to /bin/sh -c

- output of cdrecord is fugly, perhaps add --cdrecord for prettifying

- implement retreat
	so we can recover from broken disks etc

- write dvdrecord-script

- define environment variables
