EASY:
	- figure out exact byte sizes of CDR, CDR-80, DVD

MEDIUM:
	- add date/time session stretch

	- add "name" chunk stretch

DONE!	- perhaps merge split and joinpipe (suggestion of "Kei" and Mel Roman)

	- i18n

HARD:
	- output of cdrecord is fugly, perhaps add --cdrecord for prettifying

	- implement retreat
		so we can recover from broken disks etc

	- implement retry in joinpipe

	- define environment variables
	
	- take out getopt_long stuff, it is somewhat ugly

	- open /dev/tty and poll it in the loop

	- allow single key commands during the process

Done:

DONE!	- make buildStretch, which appends stretches to a string

DONE!	- teach writen about EAGAIN

DONE!	- manpages

hmm	- write dvdrecord-script
